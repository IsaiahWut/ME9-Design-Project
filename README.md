# ME9 Inclusive Playground Carousel Design Project

## Introduction

This project involved designing an **inclusive playground ride** suitable for outdoor public playgrounds, accommodating all users including individuals using mobility devices such as wheelchairs. The goal was to create a playground ride that stimulates the vestibular system, following the **ADA Standards for amusement rides and play areas** and conforming to the **Seven Principles of Universal Design**.

The ride accommodates at least two users simultaneously, including wheelchair users, with at least two degrees of freedom—rotation and vertical motion. It fits within a 12 x 12-foot footprint and features manual activation by a third person. Safety, accessibility, and aesthetics were key design considerations.

## Problem Definition

The design had to:

- Fit within a 12 x 12-foot footprint.
- Adhere to ADA standards and universal design principles.
- Stimulate the vestibular system via rotational and vertical movement.
- Withstand environmental wear: sun exposure, temperature changes, and corrosion.
- Include features for wheelchair loading/unloading and secure locking.
- Provide handrails/support bars for user stability.
- Ensure ride motion is safe and comfortable for all users.

Materials considered included weather-resistant stainless steel and UV-resistant coatings to enhance durability.

## Concept Selection

Multiple design concepts were evaluated using a **decision matrix** with weighted criteria such as inclusivity, safety, fun, workload for the operator, aesthetics, size, durability, ease of entry/exit for mobility devices, maintenance, and weather resistance.

Scores ranged from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) for each criterion. The **carousel design** achieved the highest score (116), outperforming alternatives like the swing (109) and seesaw (94). Its strengths included inclusivity and ease of entry/exit, making it the optimal solution.

## Embodiment Design

### Assembly Overview

The final carousel design consists of custom SolidWorks components including:

- Base platform
- Center column with bearing housing
- Ramps for accessibility
- Railings for safety
- Seats for non-wheelchair users
- Grooved slots to secure wheelchair users
- Vertical springs beneath the base to provide vertical movement

This design achieves two degrees of freedom: full rotation around a vertical axis and vertical up-and-down motion via springs.

## Engineering Design Process

This project followed a systematic engineering design process:

1. **Problem Definition:** Clear identification of design constraints and user needs, including ADA compliance and universal design principles.

2. **Research:** Studying playground safety standards, vestibular system stimulation, materials science, and accessibility requirements.

3. **Concept Generation:** Brainstorming multiple ride concepts (carousel, swing, seesaw) with sketches and initial models.

4. **Concept Selection:** Using a decision matrix with weighted criteria to objectively select the best design.

5. **Detailed Design & Modeling:** Creating custom parts and assemblies in SolidWorks, emphasizing manufacturability, safety, and durability.

6. **Evaluation & Iteration:** Reviewing design performance against requirements, safety, and usability principles.

7. **Finalization:** Completing detailed models and documentation ready for potential prototyping or manufacturing.

## Conclusions

The final carousel design meets the core project requirements and effectively applies the Seven Principles of Universal Design:

- **Equitable Use:** Accommodates both wheelchair and non-wheelchair users.
- **Flexibility in Use:** Multiple ways to use the ride, including sitting, securing wheelchairs, or pushing.
- **Simple & Intuitive Use:** Easy to understand and operate.
- **Perceptible Information:** Bright colors indicate functional parts.
- **Tolerance for Error:** Safety railings minimize risk.
- **Low Physical Effort:** Ride spins continuously once started.
- **Size & Space for Approach:** Fits users of varying size and mobility needs.

## Recommendations for Future Work

- Incorporate a grooved track beneath the carousel base to enhance vertical movement.
- Add a shell covering around wheelchair slots for increased stability.
- Design larger seats to accommodate more users simultaneously.
- Explore additional vestibular stimulation elements.
